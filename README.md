<h1>Welcome to our Simple Website</h1>
This website is built using only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It is designed to showcase a dynamic rendering of products for display and selection of different objects for visualization through interactive modals.

<h1>Dynamic Product Rendering</h1>
We use JavaScript to dynamically render products onto the page. This allows us to update the products displayed on the website without having to manually update the HTML.

<h1>Interactive Modals</h1>
We use JavaScript and CSS to create interactive modals that allow users to select different objects for visualization. These modals are triggered by user interactions such as clicking on a button or hovering over an object.
